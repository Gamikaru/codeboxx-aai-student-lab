4. **Reference Materials**:
   - Review slide notes for conceptual explanations

### Path to Advanced Topics (AAI-102, AAI-103, AAI-104)

As you progress through the curriculum:

1. Each module builds on previous knowledge
2. Continue working through notebooks sequentially within each module
3. Common datasets and tools in the centralized folders will be used across modules
